Google officially released Kubernetes as an open-source project back in mid-2014. 
The actual reason for the development of Kubernetes was that back in the 2000s handling Gmail, youtube, and google searches were becoming difficult because 
of the costs involved in running these popular services back in those days, this eventually led to the birth of the borg project, which developed a cluster 
management system that was essential for google for handling all the traffic it had on its services.  

With docker evolving as the epicenter of solutions for most of the container management problems, Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie saw an
opportunity to combine all the magnificent elements of the borg/omega (borg's successor) project and docker's containers leading to the development of the 
current Kubernetes.
Significant changes occurred in the projects when the decision of making the project open-source happened since it wasn't getting traction in the market if
it were a closed source.
