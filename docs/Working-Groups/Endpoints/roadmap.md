# What is a good roadmap for the Rap-god API

This working group is effectively the back-end dev working group that‚Äôd effectively be concerned about making endpoints, etc. We‚Äôll be linking the API docs to this soon! We‚Äôll be following the OpenAPI v3 spec and if you haven‚Äôt read it don‚Äôt worry : )

These are just overviews/top-level guidelines that can be followed based on your expertise, feel free to follow them as you wish.

## Javascript

We are currently using the ES2015 standard to write Express based back-end code. Express is a backend based framework that is written in an older standard of Javascript. We transpile the newer standard of Javascript (ES2015) using Babel.

### TLDRüòâ; Don‚Äôt worry if you know nothing about back-end development, Learn ES2015 based JS.

- [Babel Docs for ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/)

## ExpressJS

Express JS is the backend framework with which we‚Äôll implement our API Endpoints. The framework has a set of tools/functionality with which you can implement a lot of backend features. You can read about Express JS in the below mentioned resources. A simple endpoint would be like

```
app.get(‚Äú/‚Äù, (req,res) => {
     res.send(‚ÄúWelcome to RapGOD‚Äù);
     }
)
```

## CassandraDB - Fundamentals

**DISCLAIMER** : This is not the same as [K8ssandra](https://k8ssandra.io/)

Apache Cassandra is the database that we‚Äôll be using initially to implement the Rap-GOD API , the database will store our data as collections. Apache Cassandra has a wide variety of features that is unique to itself, You can read about them as you progress.

- [Cassandra Basics](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/cassandra-basics.html)

## Cassandra - ORM

To query data from our database, we can implement CQL queries that query data from the Database and return it, but this is not efficient as it is operationally complex. To solve this, we use ORM/ODM (Object Relational/Document Mapper) that maps the objects in your programming language to the elements in your database.

We‚Äôll be using [Express-Cassandra](https://express-cassandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for this project

## Adding Middleware

Middleware provides access to the API Calls with access to the request object, they get invoked every time an endpoint is being called.

_Middleware_ functions are functions that have access to the[ request object](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) (req), the[ response object](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) (res), and the next middleware function in the application‚Äôs request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

## OpenAPI

Wow, you have now come to the near end of the first cycle of learning, this is the time where you learn about OpenAPI .

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

You can learn about it here:
