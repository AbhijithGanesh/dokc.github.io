# Database Specifics

We'll be using various databases according to the working group plans. The specific implementation of various databases
will vary depending upon the internal architecture of the database. Those implementational differences will be record here. We'll
also record the operational issues developers will be facing when using the packages.

## What is in common to all these databases?

The databases when implemented through Kubernetes will have the following similarities. There will be few similariies as Kubernetes internally executes through the same API Infrastrucutre.

Shared Internal API Resources:

- Statefulsets
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims
- StorageClasses
- Kubernetes Secrets
- Config Maps

### Statefulsets

This is the workload option/controller we'll be using to deploy a database on Kuberenetes. We'll be using _statefulsets_ for the same kind.
Volumes are eventually mounted and configured accordingly. Example statefulset

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3 # by default is 1
  minReadySeconds: 10 # by default is 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # has to match .spec.selector.matchLabels
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              name: web
          volumeMounts:
            - name: www
              mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: www
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        storageClassName: "my-storage-class"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

### Persistent Volumes

Kubernetes allows smooth data storage through persistent volumes which we'll be configuring through the same. Persistent Volume is the go to method for _managing storage_. The PersistentVolume subsystem provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed. To do this, we introduce two new API resources: PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.

### Persistent Volume Claims

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany, see AccessModes).

### Storage Classes

A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes itself is unopinionated about what classes represent. This concept is sometimes called "profiles" in other storage systems.

### Kuberenets Secrets

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in a container image. Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.

Because Secrets can be created independently of the Pods that use them, there is less risk of the Secret (and its data) being exposed during the workflow of creating, viewing, and editing Pods. Kubernetes, and applications that run in your cluster, can also take additional precautions with Secrets, such as avoiding writing secret data to nonvolatile storage.

Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but are specifically intended to hold confidential data.
