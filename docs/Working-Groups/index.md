# What are working Groups ?

Working groups are a team of few contributors who'd specifically focus on the specific topic/mandate of the working group.
A working group, or working party, is a group of contributors working together to achieve specified goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area. The term can sometimes refer to an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers working on new activities/tasks.
