# Data on Kubernetes Community

We host live meetups every week where technologists share their stories, wisdom, and practical advice for running data on Kubernetes.

DoKC is seeking meetup talks from practitioners that describe the use cases, techniques, and best practices for running data on K8s.

DoKC is funded by sponsors who believe the industry needs a place to collaborate to solve the challenges of working with data on Kubernetes.
